# World-Happiness-Index
*Final Project for UCSB PSTAT 131 Data Mining*


**Dataset**: World Happiness Report 2016


**Abstract**

The purpose of this project is to investigate the effects of six socio-economic and economic variables on happiness within a country. I will use decision tree and logistic regression classification algorithms with the aim of producing a model that efficiently and accurately predicts whether or not a country will be classified as "happy" based on the given explanatory variables. 


**Introduction:**

In the presence of growing backlash against GDP as the sole indicator of economic progress within a country, world leaders have begun utilizing alternative socio-economic factors as indicators of the progress of living standards within a country. One example of such indicators is percieved life satisfaction and emotional well being; or, more simply stated, happiness. In order to better understand how certain economic and social factors contribute to a population's perceived level of happiness; I conducted statistical analysis of the 2016 Updated World Happiness Report data using R software.  


**Data Description**

For the data I used an abridged version of the 2016 Updated World Happiness Report data, which was published by the UN's Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) on Kaggle for public use. The data set included 156 countries and 13 columns: Happiness Rank, Happiness Score, Lower Confidence Interval, Upper Confidence Interval, Economy/ GDP per capita, Family, Health Life Expectancy, Freedom, Trust/ Government Corruption, Generosity, and Dystopia. I decided on utilizing six attributes of interest when creating the classification models:
1. GDP
2. Family
3. Health
4. Freedom
5. Trust
6. Generosity
